From Concept to Code: Building an AI Censor Tool

6 weeks ago: "Why hasn't anyone automated this?"
Today: 1000+ lines, GPU acceleration, production-ready.

Lessons learned:
⚡ GPU code isn't scary
🤖 Whisper API is powerful
📚 Documentation is critical
🎯 MVP first, features later

The journey:
1. Built audio pipeline
2. Added GPU support
3. Video processing
4. Batch operations
5. Polish & docs

Sometimes the best projects are the ones you build for yourself.
